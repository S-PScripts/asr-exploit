# asr-exploit
This webview was found by me, S-PScripts.

## Discovery:
-> ASR was one of the two apps our school allowed from the Play Store, the other being myViewboard WhiteBoard. Unlike myViewboard, ASR was force-installed without any way to uninstall it. <br>
-> I knew that this app had to have a webview somewhere. Even though I had already found one in myViewboard, I was determined. I had tried finding it for quite a bit but couldn't find any... but I eventually found it! At 11:00pm... <br>
-> Enough of me talking now, here are the instructions. <br>
